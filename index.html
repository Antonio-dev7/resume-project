In our case, the profile photo will act as our logo because that's how our 
character Rosie is going to present herself. She's the brand.
Now in Bootstrap 4, the first child following a row has to have a column class.
So what we're just going to do is change our <div> here to an anchor tag so that
it's a link, and that's going to connect us back to index.html.
As well as the class of column, we're also going to give it a class of logo so that 
we can access our image and style our logo.
